TIME: 10/26/2018 05:05:29 | COMMENT: Using this as a private Blog im writing about Fallout: Doomfield... IVE STARTED CODING, well retexturing 1995 Doom into a new Fallout franchise title. I figured they reworked doom into the fallout engine, why not the other way around. GOAL: to make a free roam sandbox title of fallout flavor capable of running on basically any modern smartphone, the web, and pc's.... eventually convincing bethesda to buy it for crossplatform multiplayer |  | ADDRESS: 68.47.9.79 ↛
